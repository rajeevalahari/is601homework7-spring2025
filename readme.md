# Docker and Python

For this assignment, I combined Docker with Python to create a program that generates a QR code PNG file containing a URL. The generated QR code directs users to my GitHub homepage.

> **Example URL:** `https://github.com/rajeevalahari`

## Overview

- Used Python to generate a QR code.
- Containerize the Python application using Docker.
- Customize the QR code generation using environment variables.
- View logs to confirm successful QR code creation.

## Submission Requirements

1. **QR Code Image**

## How It Works

1. **QR Code Generation:**  
   The Python program generates a QR code image linking to your GitHub homepage. The URL and other appearance settings are controlled via environment variables.

2. **Docker Container:**  
   The application is containerized using Docker. The provided Docker commands allow you to build the image, run the container, and mount volumes for saving the QR code output.

3. **Logging:**  
   Logs are generated by the container to indicate the success of QR code creation. You can view these logs with the `docker logs container_name` command.
